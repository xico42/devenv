# codeherd — Parallel Agentic Coding Session Manager

## Purpose

`codeherd` is a personal CLI for managing parallel agentic coding sessions. It organizes projects and git worktrees, configures per-agent environments with deterministic port allocation, and orchestrates tmux sessions where AI coding agents run independently.

It is agent-agnostic: any CLI tool (Claude Code, Aider, Codex, or a custom script) can be a named agent with its own command, arguments, and environment variables. codeherd manages the container around the agent — the tmux session, the worktree, the environment — not the agent itself.

Each session is independent. A codeherd session running Claude Code with Agent Teams, another running Aider, and a third running a plain shell can coexist. codeherd does not care what runs inside; it cares about the infrastructure that makes parallel work possible.

---

## Inspiration

This project draws from the workflow described in:

> **Claude Code On-The-Go** — https://granda.org/en/2026/01/02/claude-code-on-the-go/

The article runs six Claude Code agents in parallel on an ephemeral cloud VM, using git worktrees for isolation, tmux for session persistence, and deterministic port allocation to avoid conflicts. codeherd takes the same foundational ideas — worktrees, tmux, deterministic ports — and builds a structured CLI around them, with project awareness, named agent configurations, and automatic environment setup.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Primitives first

`codeherd` is built **primitives-first**. The core commands (`project`, `worktree`, `session`, `config`) are independent, composable building blocks. Each is useful on its own and testable in isolation.

Higher-level automation (e.g., a single `ch setup` command that clones a project, creates a worktree, generates the environment, and starts a session) will be built **on top of** these primitives, not instead of them. This layering is intentional:

1. **Primitives are stable** — the individual operations (clone a repo, create a worktree, start a session) are well-defined and unlikely to change.
2. **Composite commands are opinionated** — a "start everything" command embeds workflow assumptions that differ between use cases. Building it on stable primitives means the opinions live in one place.
3. **Debuggability** — when something fails in a composite flow, the user can drop down to the primitive that failed and run it in isolation.

### Project-aware, not just worktree-aware

Unlike tools that treat worktrees as the primary unit, codeherd treats **projects** as the organizing concept. A project has a git repository URL, a default branch, and potentially many worktrees. Sessions are anchored to a project and branch — `myapp-feature`, not just `feature`. This means:

- Worktrees from different projects never collide
- The TUI can group sessions by project
- Composite commands can operate on "all worktrees for project X"

### Agent-agnostic with named configurations

Agents are defined once in config and selected at session start:

```toml
[agents.claude]
cmd = "claude"
args = ["--dangerously-skip-permissions"]

[agents.aider]
cmd = "aider"
args = ["--model", "opus"]
```

This decouples the session lifecycle from any specific agent. The same worktree can host a Claude session today and an Aider session tomorrow. Agent selection happens at runtime via `--agent` flag or TUI picker.

### Local-first, remote-capable

All session management commands execute **directly on the machine where codeherd is invoked** — git, tmux, and filesystem operations run locally with no SSH indirection.

This means codeherd works on any machine: a laptop, a cloud VM, a remote server. The same commands, same config structure, same behavior everywhere.

Remote execution (spinning up ephemeral DO droplets and running sessions there) is a planned capability that extends this model. The session primitives stay the same; only the execution target changes.

---

## Goals

1. **Project-aware session management** — sessions are anchored to projects and branches, with structured directory layouts and clear naming.
2. **Named agent configurations** — define agents once in config, select at session start. Each agent has its own command, arguments, and environment.
3. **Deterministic environment setup** — `.env.template` processing with hash-based port allocation (`port "name"`) eliminates conflicts across parallel sessions.
4. **Automatic project bootstrapping** — clone, create worktree, generate environment, start session — composable primitives that chain into one-step setup.
5. **Agent-agnostic** — any CLI tool can be a named agent. codeherd manages the session container, not the agent.
6. **TUI for fleet overview** — visual dashboard showing all sessions, their status, and quick actions (attach, start, stop).
7. **Self-contained binary** — a single Go binary with no runtime dependencies beyond git and tmux.
8. **Remote execution (future)** — same interface on ephemeral DO droplets when local resources are insufficient.

---

## Non-Goals

- Not a replacement for Agent Teams or subagents (complementary — a codeherd session can run Agent Teams inside it)
- Not a general-purpose infrastructure tool (use Terraform/Pulumi for that)
- Not multi-user
- Not a container orchestration tool
- Not a mobile-first tool or push notification system

---

## Use Cases

### Primary: Parallel agentic coding sessions

Run multiple AI coding agents in parallel, each in its own tmux session with an isolated git worktree. Different agents (Claude, Aider, Codex) can run side by side. Switch between sessions via tmux or the TUI.

### Primary: Multi-project development

Work across multiple projects simultaneously. Each project has its own directory layout, worktrees, and sessions. The TUI groups everything by project for quick navigation.

### Secondary: Offloading to remote compute (future)

When local resources are insufficient for the number of parallel agents needed, spin up an ephemeral DO droplet and run the same sessions there. Same interface, same config, same workflow — just more compute.

### Secondary: Isolated experiments

Create a worktree for a throwaway branch, start an agent session, let it work, review the results, delete everything. The worktree isolation means experiments never touch the main checkout.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Go 1.26 |
| CLI framework | [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) |
| TUI | [Bubble Tea v2](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) + [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss) |
| DO API client (future) | [godo](https://github.com/digitalocean/godo) — Digital Ocean's official Go client |
| Provisioning (future) | cloud-init (user-data YAML) |
| Config format | TOML |
| Linter | golangci-lint |

### Command structure

| Command | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `ch config` | Manage configuration (init, show, set, get) | Done |
| `ch project` | Manage project clones (list, show, clone) | Done |
| `ch worktree` | Manage git worktrees (list, new, delete, shell, env) | Done |
| `ch session` | Manage tmux sessions (start, list, attach, stop, show) | Done |
| `ch tui` | Interactive dashboard | Done |
| `ch setup` | One-command project bootstrapping | Planned |
| `ch up` | Create remote droplet | Planned (remote phase) |
| `ch down` | Destroy remote droplet | Planned (remote phase) |
| `ch status` | Show remote droplet status | Planned (remote phase) |
| `ch ssh` | Connect to remote droplet | Planned (remote phase) |

### tmux session architecture

Each agent session runs in its own tmux session. Shell sessions and the TUI also run as tmux sessions:

```
tmux sessions:
  codeherd         <- TUI / management session
  myapp-feature    <- agent session (Claude Code)
  myapp-fix-123    <- agent session (Aider)
  api-experiment   <- agent session (Claude Code)
  myapp-shell      <- permanent shell session
```

Navigation uses tmux's built-in session switching:
- `Ctrl+B s` — session picker (shows all sessions)
- `Ctrl+B ( / )` — previous / next session

## Key File Locations

| Purpose | Path |
|---|---|
| CLI config | `~/.config/codeherd/config.toml` |
| Droplet state (future) | `~/.local/share/codeherd/state.json` |
| Binary | `~/.local/bin/ch` |

### `~/.config/codeherd/config.toml` structure

```toml
[defaults]
projects_dir = "~/projects"      # base directory for project clones and worktrees
agent = "claude"                 # default agent for new sessions

[agents.claude]
cmd = "claude"
args = ["--dangerously-skip-permissions"]

[agents.claude.env]
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR = "/custom"

[agents.aider]
cmd = "aider"
args = ["--model", "opus"]

[projects.myapp]
repo = "git@github.com:user/myapp.git"
default_branch = "main"
# cloned to: ~/projects/github.com/user/myapp/

[projects.api]
repo = "git@github.com:user/api.git"
default_branch = "develop"

# Future: remote execution config
# [defaults]
# token = "..."                  # DO API token
# ssh_key_id = "..."             # DO SSH key ID
# region = "nyc3"
# size = "s-2vcpu-4gb"
# tailscale_auth_key = "..."
#
# [profiles.heavy]
# size = "s-8vcpu-16gb"
# region = "sfo3"
```

### Project directory layout

Clone paths mirror the repo URL structure under `projects_dir` (like `ghq` / Go module paths):

```
~/projects/
  github.com/
    user/
      myapp/                       <- main clone
      myapp__worktrees/
        feature/                   <- worktree for branch "feature"
        fix-123/                   <- worktree for branch "fix-123"
      api/                         <- different project
  gitlab.com/
    corp/
      backend/
        api/                       <- clone from gitlab
        api__worktrees/
          develop/                 <- worktree
```

## Agent Session Context

When starting a new agent session to continue development on this project, provide this file as context. Key decisions already made:

1. **Go + Cobra** for the CLI
2. **Bubble Tea v2** for the TUI (not v1)
3. **XDG-compliant** file locations (config in `~/.config`, state in `~/.local/share`)
4. **Go version**: 1.26 (managed via mise)
5. **Binary install location**: `~/.local/bin/ch`
6. **All session commands run locally** — no SSH indirection for project/worktree/session
7. **Each agent session = one tmux session** — management in `codeherd` session
8. **projects_dir is configurable** — default `~/projects`
9. **Clone paths mirror repo URL** — `~/projects/github.com/user/myapp/` (like `ghq` / Go modules)
10. **Named agents** — `[agents.<name>]` in config, selected via `--agent` flag or TUI picker
11. **Session state stored in tmux** — user-defined options on tmux sessions, no state files
12. **Agent-agnostic** — codeherd manages the session container, agents are pluggable
13. **Digital Ocean** as the cloud provider for the remote execution phase
14. **godo** for DO API access (not doctl CLI)
15. **cloud-init** for droplet provisioning (not Ansible, not remote scripts)
16. **Tailscale** for remote networking (no public SSH port)

## TODO / Deferred Ideas

Ideas and features that came up during development but were intentionally deferred.

| Idea | Context | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ch config project add <name>` wizard | Came up during `config` command design | Interactive prompts for repo URL + default branch; alternative to `config set projects.<name>.repo ...` + `config set projects.<name>.default_branch ...`; no API calls needed |
| Session groups / batch operations | Natural extension of project-awareness | Start/stop all sessions for a project; "refresh all worktrees" |
| Agent health monitoring | TUI enhancement | Detect stuck agents, auto-restart, resource usage alerts |
| Template-based project setup | Extension of `.env.template` | Per-project setup scripts that run after worktree creation (install deps, build, etc.) |
